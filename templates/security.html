<h4>Reporting security bugs</h4>

If you discover a security issue in ivatar, please report it to us privately so
that we can push a fix to the main service before disclosing the problem
publicly. We will credit you publicly (unless you don't want to) with this
discovery.
<p></p>
The best way to do that is to file a security bug on our
<a href="https://git.linux-kernel.at/oliver/ivatar/issues/new"
   title="https://git.linux-kernel.at/oliver/ivatar/issues/new" target="_new">
  bug tracker
</a>. Make sure you change the bug visibility (see "This issue is confidential
and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access") and
set the 'Security' label.
<p></p>
Alternatively, you can talk to us at
<a href="mailto:security@libravatar.org"
  title="mailto:security@libravatar.org">
  security@libravatar.org
</a>.
<br/>
We will do our best to respond to you within 24-48 hours.
<br/>
Also, please let us know if you are under any kind of publication deadline.
<p></p>
